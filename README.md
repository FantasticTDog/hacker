# üéÆ HACKER: The Code Generation Game

> *"In a world where every keystroke matters, can you hack the ultimate function?"*

## ÔøΩÔøΩ What is this?

**HACKER** is a unique typing game where you're not just typing random characters - you're generating actual JavaScript code! But here's the twist: every time you press a key, instead of your actual keystroke, the game generates a random piece of real JavaScript code. Your mission? Type until you generate the exact function name that the game has secretly chosen as your target.

## ÔøΩÔøΩ The Mission

1. **Boot Up**: Watch the hacker-style initialization sequence
2. **Get Your Target**: The game reveals your mission - hack a specific function
3. **Start Typing**: Press any letter, number, or space to generate code
4. **Earn Bitcoin**: Each completed function earns you ‚Çø (money)
5. **Upgrade Your Skills**: Buy speed and complexity upgrades
6. **Win**: Generate the exact target function to claim victory!

## üéÆ How to Play

### **Basic Controls**
- **Type**: Any letter, number, or space to generate code
- **Focus**: Click the black code area to activate

### **The Code Generation**
- **Topic-Based**: Each code block uses words from the same theme (penguins, ninjas, space, etc.)
- **Real JavaScript**: Generates actual code patterns (functions, loops, conditionals, etc.)
- **Character by Character**: Code appears one character at a time (or multiple based on your speed)

### **Progression System**
- **Speed Upgrades**: From "Finger cream" to "Reality warping keyboard"
- **Complexity Upgrades**: From "Programming book" to "Reality comprehension"
- **Exponential Rewards**: Higher complexity = exponentially more Bitcoin

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Features

### **Code Generation Engine**
- **100+ Code Snippets**: Real JavaScript patterns (functions, loops, API calls, etc.)
- **40+ Topic Collections**: From penguins to quantum physics
- **20 Function Verbs**: get, set, create, destroy, etc.
- **36 Function Nouns**: server, database, interface, etc.

### **Game Mechanics**
- **Probability System**: Calculates your chances of winning
- **Exponential Money**: 2^(complexity-1) Bitcoin per function
- **Auto-Scroll**: Always see the latest code
- **Function Tracking**: See all your generated functions

### **Visual Design**
- **Hacker Aesthetic**: Green text on black background
- **Progress Bars**: Visual indicators for speed and complexity
- **Animated Elements**: Typing effects, glowing borders, pulsing text
- **Professional Dashboard**: Clean metrics display

## üé™ Fun Features

### **Hilarious Combinations**
Watch as your code generates gems like:
```javascript
function getPenguinServer() { ... }
const createNinjaDatabase = ...
try { destroyRobotInterface() } catch...
```

### **Upgrade Names**
- **Speed**: "Coffee IV drip", "Quantum fingers", "Time dilation device"
- **Complexity**: "Stack Overflow subscription", "Neural enhancement", "Omniscient coding"

### **Initialization Sequence**
Experience the full hacker boot sequence with:
- "Establishing secure connection to dark web..."
- "Loading quantum consciousness backup..."
- "Setting up reality distortion field..."

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Start the game**: `npm run dev`
4. **Begin hacking**: Click and start typing!

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Game Statistics

- **Total Possible Combinations**: Millions of unique function names
- **Win Probability**: Extremely low (that's the challenge!)
- **Upgrade Progression**: 20+ upgrades per category
- **Money Scaling**: Exponential growth system

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Victory Conditions

To win, you must generate the exact target function name. With millions of possible combinations, this requires:
- **Strategy**: Balance speed vs. complexity upgrades
- **Persistence**: Keep typing until you get lucky
- **Optimization**: Maximize your Bitcoin earnings

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Customization

The game is highly configurable:
- **Initialization Steps**: Change `INIT_STEPS` constant
- **Typing Speed**: Adjust `TYPING_INTERVAL_MS`
- **Money Formula**: Modify `getMoneyPerFunction()`
- **Upgrade Costs**: Edit the upgrades arrays

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Technical Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Custom Hooks** for game logic
- **Component Architecture** for maintainability
- **CSS Animations** for visual effects
- **Local State Management** for game progression

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Why This Game?

**HACKER** combines the satisfaction of typing with the unpredictability of code generation. It's like having a coding partner who writes random but syntactically correct JavaScript while you try to guide them toward a specific function name. The exponential money system and upgrade progression create a compelling meta-game that keeps you coming back for "just one more function."
